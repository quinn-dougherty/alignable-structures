## Lodging

Airbnb information will be here

We'll book it from wednesday afternoon (the 2nd) to monday morning (the 7th). 

## Reimbursement

Send charges to Quinn D's venmo (info in discord). If you can't use venmo for whatever reason, DM Quinn D. 

**Please** do not send me more than `$125` total in ubers. While within Philly, the major train lines that are `$2.50`/ride will take care of you getting from airbnb to venue, so your plan A should be public transit. 

Also, the `$10` train from the airport to downtown is great!

### Unreimbursed food/activities

- Wednesday and Thursday night (2nd, 3rd) dinner
- Anything/everything on the day off (Saturday)
- Also anyone who gets significantly hungry before 10am, you're on your own. 
- More than one drink at the Sunday night closing dinner

Venue should be gushing with food whenever it's open. 

If you're _extremely_ cash-constrained and this is burdensome, do reach out to me. It's not a hyper-budgeted VIP event, but we don't want the socializing to be constrained by asymmetries in ability to take on unreimbursed activities.

## Day Off

Saturday the 5th is a day of no programming in particular. 

### Have 1:1s

Coordinate in discord

### Hold an unconference

On-the-fly sessions in the airbnb are welcome. I'll bring my house's whiteboard over there. 

### Explore the city

Two things that are unusual about Philadelphia are as follows: 

#### [MÃ¼tter Museum](https://muttermuseum.org/)

Artifacts of medical misfortune

#### Revolutionary war stuff

If you're into it, the neighborhood called Old City is full of exhibits (room where the declaration was signed, liberty bell, etc.) and has a museum. 

### Do nothing

It's a day off. Rest, relax. 

### Work

Cafes, the airbnb, etc.
