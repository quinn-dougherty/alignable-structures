## PDDL.jl: A fast and flexible interface for automated model-based planning

The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal specification language for symbolic planning problems and domains that is widely used by the AI planning community. This talk presents PDDL.jl, a fast and flexible interface for planning over PDDL domains. It aims to be what PyTorch is to deep learning, or what Stan, Pyro or Gen are to Bayesian inference: A general high-performance platform for contemporary AI applications and research programs that leverage automated symbolic planning.

This talk will also serve as an introduction to the symbolic planning paradigm of AI, how it can be integrated with Bayesian methods like probabilistic programming, its relevance to inner alignment and interpretability, and its prospects as an alternative (potentially safer) scaling route to pure deep learning.
