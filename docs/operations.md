## Lodging

Airbnb information will be here

We'll book it from wednesday afternoon (the 2nd) to monday morning (the 7th). 

## Reimbursement

Send charges to Quinn D's venmo (info in discord). If you can't use venmo for whatever reason, DM Quinn D. 

**Please** do not send me more than `$125` total in ubers. While within Philly, the major train lines that are `$2.50`/ride will take care of you getting from airbnb to venue. 

Wednesday and Thursday (2nd and 3rd) night dinners, and all day off (Saturday the 5th) activities are not reimbursable. If you're _extremely_ cash constrained and find this burdensome, reach out to quinn#9100. This isn't a massively budgeted super VIP operation, but we don't want social activities to exclude people. 

## Day Off

Saturday the 5th is a day of no programming in particular. 

### Have 1:1s

Coordinate in discord

### Hold an unconference

On-the-fly sessions in the airbnb are welcome. 

### Explore the city

Two things that are unusual about Philadelphia are as follows: 

#### [MÃ¼tter Museum](https://muttermuseum.org/)

Artifacts of medical misfortune

#### Revolutionary war stuff

If you're into it, the neighborhood called Old City is full of exhibits (room where the declaration was signed, liberty bell, etc.) and has a museum. 

### Do nothing

It's a day off. Rest, relax. 

### Work

Cafes, the airbnb, etc.
