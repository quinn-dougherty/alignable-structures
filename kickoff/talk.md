- We would like for software not to do bad stuff
- What you can expect from us
- What we can expect from you

# We would like for software not to do bad stuff

## Diversity of threat models

- Some of you are focused on software not killing everybody
- Others not quite so dramatic

## Are we the baddies?

Let's be rigorous about dual use properties, should they arise

Try to figure out in what worldviews research seems bad, and in what worldviews it seems good

# What you can expect from us

## Team

### It's small

- Richard Ren and some other Penn EA execs are doing ops support around food
- Brittany is the point person for airbnb stuff, and she'll probably know more than me about what's going on there
- Venue troubles (like keycard): come to me
- I'm really responsive on discord, but find my phone number on the docs site if there's an emergency
- Backup if you can't get ahold of me: Stephen or Brittany

## Health (covid)

- House and venue each have supply of covid tests.
- Being commonsensical rather than tyrannical, not really planning on micromanaging this.
- N95s are available

## Venue

- Downstairs front door punch card access is from 9a to 9p thursday through sunday.
- We can stay in the venue after 9p, we're just locked in at that point.

# What we can expect from you

## Website is source of truth, but pay attention to discord

- Things that change on the fly will be pushed to docs site.
- But they'll also be posted to discord.
  - Don't be afraid to tailor your notifications on a per-channel basis.
- I just wanna know that information is propagating

## Norms (lifted from lesswrong)

- Aim to explain, not persuade
- Try to offer concrete models and predictions
- If you disagree, try getting curious about what your partner is thinking
- Don't be afraid to say 'oops' and change your mind

## Unconference (Sunday afternoon)

- Try to think of things you want to do for unconference, loose threads to follow up on, throughout.

## Let's try to be on time and not hallway track

- Evenings and saturday for hallway track please!
- Schedule is clearly marked
  - If you're skipping Vanessa's deep dives, roll in after 12 on Friday and Sunday (lunch is at 12 both those days)
  - Wrapping up between 5 and 6 each day

# That's it, have fun
