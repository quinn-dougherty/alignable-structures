# NARS

Logic should return its focus to valid reasoning in real-world situations. Since classical logic only covers valid reasoning in a highly idealized situation, there is a demand for a new logic for everyday reasoning that is based on more realistic assumptions, while still keeps the general, formal, and normative nature of logic. NAL (Non-Axiomatic Logic) is built for this purpose, which is based on the assumption that the reasoner has insufficient knowledge and resources with respect to the reasoning tasks to be carried out. In this situation, the notion of validity has to be re-established, and the grammar rules and inference rules of the logic need to be designed accordingly. Consequently, NAL has features very different from classical logic and other non-classical logics, and it provides a coherent solution to many problems in logic, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.
