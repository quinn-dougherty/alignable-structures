Saturday the 5th is a day of no programming in particular. 

### Have 1:1s

Coordinate in discord

### Hold an unconference

On-the-fly sessions in the airbnb are welcome. 

### Explore the city

Two things that are unusual about Philadelphia are as follows: 

#### [MÃ¼tter Museum](https://muttermuseum.org/)

Artifacts of medical misfortune

#### Revolutionary war stuff

If you're into it, the neighborhood called Old City is full of exhibits (room where the declaration was signed, liberty bell, etc.) and has a museum. 

### Do nothing

It's a day off. Rest, relax. 

### Work

Cafes, the airbnb, etc.
